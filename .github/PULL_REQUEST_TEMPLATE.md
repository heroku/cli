<!--
Note: Windows jobs on CircleCI will sometimes fail to exit (a bug in their containers), if this happens simply re-run the job or workflow.

When creating a PR, be sure to prepend the PR title with the Conventional Commit type (`feat`, `fix`, or `chore`) and the package name.

Examples:

`feat(spaces): add growl notification to spaces:wait`

`fix(apps-v5): handle special characters in app names`

`chore(ci): refactor tests`

`chore(autocomplete): update typings`

`chore(cli): edit README`
