Overview
========

This is the next generation Go/Node-based Heroku CLI.  The goals of this project were to make plugins more flexible, remove Ruby as a runtime dependency, and make the CLI faster.

It has identical functionality to the old Ruby CLI. Under the hood, it is a modular CLI made up of node.js plugins.

For more on developing plugins, read [Developing CLI Plugins](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/developing-cli-plugins)

Developing

Developing the CLI locally requires go and node.

To run the CLI locally, use the `./bin/run` script. If you want to install the dev version of the CLI, run `make install`.
